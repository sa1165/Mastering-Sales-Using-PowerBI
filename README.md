Power BI, adds another layer of complexity, as it requires ensuring seamless data 
preprocessing, feature engineering, and model integration. Additionally, the 
challenge of providing a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that offers real
time analytics and actionable business intelligence needs to be addressed effectively.

DATA UNDERSTANDING

The dataset used in this analysis comprises five tables: sales_transactions, 
sales_customers, sales_products, sales_markets, and sales_date. Each table plays 
a distinct role in providing a holistic view of the sales data, enabling deeper 
insights into customer behavior, product performance, and market trends. 
 
1. Sales Transactions: This table is central to the dataset, capturing each 
transaction's details, including cost_price, currency, normalized_sales_price, 
and profit_margin. Key columns such as order_date enable time-based 
analysis, while market_code and customer_code link transactions to specific 
markets and customers. Aggregating normalized_sales_price over different 
time periods will reveal seasonal trends, and analyzing 
profit_margin_percentage aids in profitability assessments. 
 
2. Sales Customers: The sales_customers table contains customer-specific 
information, including customer_name, customer_code, and customer_type. 
By linking this table to the sales_transactions table, we can analyze customer 
purchasing behavior and segment customers by type to explore differences in 
transaction volumes and profitability. 
 
 
3. Sales Products: This table holds data on each product’s product_code and 
product_type. It connects to the sales_transactions table through product_code, 
allowing for analysis of product-specific performance. By examining sales and 
profit margins across different product types, we can identify high-performing 
and low-performing products.

4. Sales Markets: The sales_markets table provides geographical context for 
each transaction, with fields like market_code, market_name, and zone. 
Connecting this to transactions via market_code enables market-level analysis, 
such as sales performance by region, which can help identify growth 
opportunities in specific zones. 
 
 
5. Sales Date: This table supports time-based analysis with fields such as date, 
cy_date, year, and month_name. Linking dates to transactions through 
order_date allows us to aggregate sales and profit data by different time 
intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly), revealing seasonal trends and sales cycles. 
 
Together, these tables create a robust framework to analyze the dataset across 
multiple dimensions—time, geography, customer, and product. This structured 
approach will drive the analysis in uncovering key sales insights and patterns that 
can support data-driven decision-making

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase aims to understand the dataset's 
structure, key patterns, and relationships among variables to gain initial insights and 
identify trends in sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability. 
Here are the key steps and findings: 

1. Data Exploration and Summary Statistics: 
o Sales Transactions: Calculated summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, 
standard deviation) for key variables like normalized_sales_price, 
profit_margin, and cost_price to understand the distribution of sales 
values and profit margins across transactions. 
o Customer and Product Insights: Analyzed the distribution of customer 
types and product categories to identify the most popular customer 
segments and products contributing to sales. 
o Time-Based Patterns: Examined the order_date column to analyze sales 
trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly). Seasonal patterns, peaks, and 
low points in sales were identified to provide insights into demand 
cycles. 
2. Correlation Analysis: 
o Computed correlations between numerical variables such as cost_price, 
normalized_sales_price, and profit_margin to understand their 
relationships. High correlation values indicated potential influences of 
cost on sales and profitability.  
o Used correlation matrices and heatmaps to visualize relationships 
between variables, helping to identify strong or weak associations that 
may affect model selection. 
3. Customer Segmentation and Product Analysis: 
o Segmented customers based on customer types and analyzed their 
transaction volumes and profitability. This helped to identify high-value 
customer groups and assess how different segments contribute to total 
revenue. 
o Examined product categories by aggregating total sales and profit 
margins to determine the top-performing products, providing insights 
into which products are driving profitability. 
4. Geographical and Market Analysis: 
o Conducted an analysis of sales data by market and zone using the 
market_code field. Identified top-performing markets, helping to 
highlight regions with the highest sales and profit margins. 
o Visualized sales distribution across different regions to detect any 
geographic trends and identify potential growth opportunities in 
underperforming zones. 
5. Outlier Detection: 
o Identified outliers in sales and profit margins, using statistical 
techniques (e.g., Z-score, IQR). Outliers were further analyzed to 
determine if they were due to data errors or valid high-value transactions 
that could skew analysis. 
o Addressed outliers by either removing them or adjusting them as needed 
to maintain data integrity.  
6. Feature Engineering for Modeling: 
o Created time-based features such as year, month, and quarter to capture 
temporal trends. Also generated lag features (e.g., sales of previous 
months) to prepare the data for time-series forecasting. 
o Aggregated sales by product category and region to create new features 
that could improve model performance for machine learning 
predictions. 
The EDA process provided a clear view of sales patterns, customer segments, product 
performance, and market dynamics, which will guide further modeling and analysis. 
Visualizations and statistical summaries from this phase lay the foundation for 
building predictive models and developing actionable insights.
